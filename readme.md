# Internet Retail E-Commerce Back End

## Description
The E-Commerce Back End for a retail store uses several APIs made through MySQL and Object Relational Mapping. Where MySQL primarily uses tables using schemas and seeds, this includes models that we are able to move objects through the code so it is able to be used on the front end and connected to the back end to produce certain items depending on what is selected on the front end. This program includes the use of MySQL2, Sequelize, and Dotenv. To demonstrate properly, this code can be ran through Insomnia Core after running npm start in the terminal and can be used functionally in Insomnia Core.

This project was fairly straight forward given that it was nearly a branch off from the previous lesson in regards to MySQL. Sequelize helped pull together multiple tables in order to run it through and give a more directional approach to running a code on the back end using Node and NPMs. This code uses Product and Tag to go through each other in order to produce ProductTag so it can run all three of the separate models at the same time. It's efficient and I enjoyed learning it.
